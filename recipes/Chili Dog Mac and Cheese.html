    <p>
        <p>I can’t really explain why I decided to create this chili dog mac and cheese hybrid.</p>
        <p>I always get a few requests for comforting casseroles this time of year, but if the goal was to end up with a recipe that tasted like both things, I failed miserably.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if a tasty, comforting casserole was the mission, then let’s celebrate…and invite a few friends, since this thing is huge. </p>
        <p>While I did enjoy eating this, I was a bit confused why it didn’t really taste like chili dogs or mac and cheese. </p>
        <p>I knew the lack of creamy sauce might be an issue, but I thought if I stirred in enough cheese, all would be fine.</p> 
        <p>Taste and texture-wise, I was correct, but the flavors just didn’t come together as I’d hoped.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I tried, and failed, but also kind of succeeded, and if you’d like something that feels and tastes like an American goulash with hot dogs, then I really do hope you give this a try soon.</p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
